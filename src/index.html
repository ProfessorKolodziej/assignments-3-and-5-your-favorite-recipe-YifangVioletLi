	<p><strong>Oh vegan scalloped potatoes, where have you been all my life?</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I nailed it with this recipe! Sometimes (ok, often...) I have
			complete
			recipe testing failures. I try, I fail, I try, I fail again, and hopefully get it after several tries. But with
			these
			scalloped potatoes, oh my word, they were amazing from the start!</strong></p>
	<p><strong>These potatoes are SO creamy, garlicky, flavorful and over-the-top delicious. The epitome of comfort food,
			and a must
			have at any holiday meal! They will be gone so fast, and no one will guess they are vegan.</strong></p>

	<h2>How Do You Make Vegan Scalloped Potatoes?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>First, peel and slice your potatoes about 1/8 inch thick. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
		<li>Make your creamy sauce in a high powered blender like a Vitamix (raw, soaked cashews, vegetable broth,
			unsweetened non-dairy milk, nutritional yeast, and salt).</li>
		<li>Sauté an onion, thinly sliced and some garlic.</li>
		<li>Now, layer half the potatoes in a 9 x 13 inch greased baking dish.</li>
		<img src="images/IMG_03.webp">
		<li>Pour half of the sauce on top. It will be very watery at this point, which is fine. It will thicken up as the
			potatoes bake. Spread the onion/garlic mixture on top.</li>
		<img src="images/IMG_04.jpg">
		<li>Add the rest of the potatoes, and pour the rest of the sauce on top. It will look like this before you put it
			in
			the oven.</li>
		<img src="images/IMG_05.jpg">
		<li>Bake, uncovered for 60 minutes, then remove from the oven and check for doneness. The sauce should be bubbly
			and
			thick, and the potatoes should be fork tender. If not, bake a little longer, 10-20 more minutes. Then, sprinkle
			with vegan parmesan and fresh chopped chives, if desired and serve warm!</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Times</h3>
	<p>Prep: 30 minutes<br>
		Cook: 1 hour<br>
		Total: 1 hour 30 minutes<br>
		Servings: 12 servings</p>

	<h3>Can I make vegan scalloped potatoes ahead of time?</h3>
	<p>Yes, you can. Simply make the potatoes as instructed and let cool completely to room temperature. Cover tightly
		and
		refrigerate 2-3 days. I wouldn't go longer than that. When ready to serve, bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes
		until warmed through.</p>

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>May leave out the onions and garlic if desired, but they add a lot of flavor to the dish.</li>
		<li>I like using yukon gold potatoes in this recipe, but russets will work as well. Or try sweet potatoes for
			variety!</li>
		<li>Try to slice your potatoes similar levels of thickness; this will help them cook more evenly. If you slice
			your
			potatoes thicker, they will take longer to cook, so keep this in mind.</li>
	</ul>
